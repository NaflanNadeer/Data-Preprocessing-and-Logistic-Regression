Machine Learning with Logistic Regression and Data Preprocessing
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate fundamental steps in data preprocessing and implementing a logistic regression model using Python. These notebooks serve as a foundation for building and preparing machine learning models.

Notebooks
1. Logistic Regression on Social Network Ads Data
This notebook uses a logistic regression model to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on age and estimated salary.

Dataset: Social_Network_Ads.csv (dataset attached, fictional)
Steps:
Data splitting into training and test sets.
Feature scaling for normalization.
Model training with logistic regression.
Predicting and evaluating results with a confusion matrix.
Visualizing decision boundaries on training and test data to illustrate model performance.
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

2. Data Preprocessing Tools
This notebook covers essential data preprocessing techniques to prepare structured data for machine learning models.

Steps:
Handling missing values with SimpleImputer.
Encoding categorical data using ColumnTransformer and LabelEncoder.
Feature scaling for normalization.
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn


To run these notebooks:
* Clone this repository.
* Open each notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
* Install the required libraries if needed.
* Run the cells in order to see the data preprocessing and model training steps in action.
